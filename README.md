Building:

  1.  Install SDR++ core headers to /usr/include/sdrpp_core/, if not installed. Refer to https://cropinghigh.github.io/sdrpp-moduledb/headerguide.html about how to do that

      OR if you don't want to use my header system, add -DSDRPP_MODULE_CMAKE="/path/to/sdrpp_build_dir/sdrpp_module.cmake" to cmake launch arguments

      Install ITPP package.

  2.  Build:

          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake ..
          make
          sudo make install

  3.  Enable new module by adding it via Module manager
